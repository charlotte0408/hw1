## Description of the project
- This project is a single-player version of the card game known as **Blackjack**.
- The goal of the game is to get cards whose total value comes the closest to **21** without going over it. Getting a card total over 21 is called “busting”.

## Rule of the game
At each round of play the player places a bet. After that, the player and the dealer each draw one card from the deck.The player is then repeatedly asked if another card is wanted. The player can continue to draw cards while the total is less than 21. After the player’s turn is over, the dealer’s cards are shown. The dealer’s play is always the same: the dealer continues to draw cards only if the total is less than 16.
